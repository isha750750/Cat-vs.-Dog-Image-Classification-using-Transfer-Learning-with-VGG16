# Cat-vs.-Dog-Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16
This project implements a cat vs. dog image classifier using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model. VGG16's convolutional layers are used as a fixed feature extractor, while custom fully connected layers are trained for classification. Data augmentation and evaluation ensure model robustness and accuracy
